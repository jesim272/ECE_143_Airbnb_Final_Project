## Problem 

Looking for the ideal Airbnb may be daunting for travellers and hosts, especially not knowing what factors come into play. By understanding the host-customer relationship one may determine the important factors that contribute to the decision making process for the housing.

## Summary 
By analyzing the correlation between price and various external factors (ie reviews, room type, region, time of season, host rating, occupancy rate) and the profitability for hosts (through review metrics, price, number of listings per host, estimated occupancy, etc.), a better understanding of host-customer relationship was drawn.

## Methodology
1. Visualized the price of a shared room, hotel room, entire home/apt, private room and average price of them all during a 5 year time span to understand the price trend.

2. Plotted the availability of a shared room, hotel room, entire home/apt, private room and average availiablity of them all to have an understanding of the most favorable type of room chosen by customers.

## Dataset 
The data obtained can be found in the following links:

* [Airbnb Data Pool](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html "Airbnb Data Pool")

* Airbnb San Diego Dataset ([download](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ca/san-diego/2021-01-23/visualisations/listings.csv "Airbnb San Diego Dataset") )

Airbnb Datasets are created by Airbnb, an online marketplace company that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodation in that locale. Airbnb Datasets contain a lot of different csv files during different time periods. They record the price, room type, occupancy rate, host rating, location of room, etc. By analyzing Airbnb Datasets, we can find some relationship between those factors. 

## Applications
Cross-correlate to ultimately determine the best Airbnb in San Diego. From the host side, they’ll have an example for how to improve their listings while the travelers find their ideal vacation spot.
